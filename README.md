# CS224n with MLX: Implementing NLP Models on Apple Silicon

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of key concepts and models from the Stanford CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning course, using Apple's MLX deep learning library. The goal is to leverage the optimized performance of MLX on Apple Silicon to build and train state-of-the-art NLP models.
